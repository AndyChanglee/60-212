WASD to move
Space to jump

If you fall, don't fret! You'll be back where you started soon enough.
If you don't want to wait for it:

R to reset your position

Esc to close application

And if the platforming is a bit too hard for you (admittingly not a perfect platformer)
you can hold Left Shift to jump as if you were standing on something.

There's something in the end that I hope everyone gets to see.
